      <h1> Learning Plan</h1> 
      <br>
      <h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4> 
      <p> My long term goal is to one day become an entrepreneur and create software that solves people's problems and/ makes their lives easier. I want to get there by getting industry experience preferably in web development. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h4>
      <p> I believe that curiosity is one of my strengths when it comes to learning. I become curious about a subject when I'm interested in it, and I can easily spend a lot of time and effort learning more about it and trying to understand it.
        My openness and willingness to try new things are other of my strengths. It is very simple to become intimidated by learning something new, but because I believe learning is an ongoing process, I have found it to be exciting. We engage in a never-ending cycle of learning new things from birth until death. It is essential to our way of life. Our sense of perspective is expanded and altered as a result of experiencing new things in our lives. When it comes to learning limitations, procrastination is my biggest one. Procrastination has often served as a coping mechanism for me when I am overwhelmed or anxious about my academic performance. Although I understand logically that procrastinating does not help but only exacerbates my problems, I've discovered that it has often served as a default emotional coping mechanism for me. Another weakness of mine is that I often find it difficult to ask for help because I have a strong sense of independence and much prefer to deal with things on my own. This has had a negative impact on my learning because it causes me to struggle unnecessarily on my own even though there are resources and help available, which leads to me feeling stuck and causes me to take longer than necessary to complete certain tasks.</p>

      <h4>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p> Through this programme I would like to develop the following skills:
        <ol>
          <li> Problem solving skills- how to to approach and solve problems like a programmer</li>
          <li> Effective communication- communication is one of my weaknesses so I would like improve on my comminication skills as it is an essential skill in both learning and work settings</li>
          <li> Perseverance- I've realised in my coding journey that coding requires a lot of patience, especially when it comes to solving problems </li>
          <li> Teamwork</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h4>
      <p> I will try my best to manage my time by sticking to the timebox suggestions of each activity as well as aiming to study at least 8 hours a day.</p>
      <br>
      <h4> A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h4>
      <p> I will make sure to seek help whenever I'm stuck or experiencing any difficulties from my assigned facilitators on discord. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p> I excpect facilitators to be of help when needed and also offer feedback and advise on course work. </p>
