      <h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> I have more of a fixed mindset</li>
        <li>I have a hard time opening up about my feelings</li>
        <li>I've become more aware of myself</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <h4>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
      <p>Values, empathy, and self-awareness all have a significant impact on the learning and programming process. Values serve as an ethical framework and goal orientation, ensuring that software adheres to ethical standards such as privacy, fairness, and transparency. Empathy allows developers to understand their users' needs, promoting user-friendly software and effective teamwork. Self-awareness assists students in understanding their own strengths and weaknesses, thereby promoting effective learning strategies. It also helps in recognising biases that can affect code outcomes in programming. Despite not being part of the code, these characteristics influence our programming approach, team interactions, and societal impact.</p>

      <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
      <p>What surprised me the most about the core learning is how practical and impactful it is, as it has helped me rethink and reshape how I approach things not only in my learning but also in my personal life. Along the way, I've been able to improve my learning strategies as well as certain habits in my personal life.  The neuroplasticity section had the most impact on me because it made me realise I have a fixed mindset and gave me some practical ideas for shifting my mindset to a growth mindset. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
      <p>The most difficult challenge for me has been confronting myself, particularly regarding my weaknesses and limitations, as well as attempting to implement new learning strategies while unlearning old habits and strategies that no longer serve me.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
      <p>I believe this is because core learning aids in the development of soft skills required in programming.  A good programmer possesses both technical and soft skills. Soft skills are just as vital to programmers as technical skills because they improve collaboration, communication, and problem-solving. While technical skills are obviously crucial to programming, human skills are what allow programmers to use their technical skills effectively, collaborate effectively with others, and create software that benefits users and society.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
      <p>My time spent studying core has certainly not been a waste of time, in fact, it has greatly helped me to understand myself and has also increased my awareness of my learning as well as certain aspects of myself.</p>
