      <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
      <br>
      <h3>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you:</h3>
      <br>
      <h4>1. were blocked on a simple problem: </h4>
      <p>what was the problem?-  when  I was working on the deBee exercise on the Kata task, I had to use a split() and join() function, however, I didn't put a space within the strings of the functions.</p>
      <p>what problem-solving techniques did you use? - I tried to google as well as rewriting the code for a while, I finally ended up using a JS validator to see exactly where I went wrong as I was working after hours.</p>
      <p>how did you feel throughout the process? -it was quite frustrating because a seemingly minor thing was </p>
      <p>what did you learn?- to be more attentive as functions are very sensitive.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h4>
      <p>Throughout the Kata challenge, I was able to use the npm test to solve my problems with ease as it is able to precisely pinpoint my errors and it made it  quite comfortable going the challenge. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Pseudocode - not quite confident writing it yet</li>
        <li>Trying something - comfortable with it</li>
        <li>Rubber ducky method- I haven't used it yet</li>
        <li>Reading error messages- quite comfortable with it as they show me where I went wrong</li>
        <li>Console.logging- quite comfortable with it when using the DOM</li>
        <li>Googling- very comfortable with it </li>
        <li>Asking your peers for help- not quite confident yet</li>
        <li>Asking coaches for help- getting around to it</li>
        <li>Improving your process with reflection- reflections have been helpful </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h4>
        <p>I was a bit reluctant to ask for help because I was quite behind compared to everyone so I felt a bit self-conscious asking about what others had already gone through. But luckily I was able to find some solutions based on what others had previously asked.</p>
